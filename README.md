# Blog-gator üêä

Blog-gator is a command-line blog aggregator that allows you to follow your favorite RSS/Atom feeds and browse their latest posts. It's built with Go and uses PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## Prerequisites

Before running Blog-gator, you need to have the following installed:

- **Go 1.24.3 or later** - [Download here](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **PostgreSQL** - [Download here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation

Install Blog-gator using Go's package manager:

```bash
go install github.com/VMT1312/blog-gator@latest
```

This will install the `blog-gator` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory (make sure it's in your PATH).

## Configuration

### 1. Set up PostgreSQL Database

First, create a PostgreSQL database for Blog-gator:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE blog_gator;
```

### 2. Create Configuration File

Blog-gator uses a JSON configuration file that should be located at `~/.gatorconfig.json`. Create this file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://username:password@localhost/blog_gator?sslmode=disable",
  "current_user_name": ""
}
```

Replace `username` and `password` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

### 3. Run Database Migrations

The application will automatically handle database schema creation when you first run it.
